title: "Creating Kubernetes Kind Cluster"

In an earlier post I showed how to create [Multinode k8s cluster using ignite and k3s]({{< relref "multinode-k8s-ignite-k3s.md" >}}), while this was a good experience I needed to test some other tools, and this time I decided to go for kind (kubernetes in docker). Which looks like a good approach to work with clusters locally and it will still be lightweight as the kubernetes "nodes" will be actually running as docker containers. This at first glance looks like a easier approach and seems to work in a similar way in Mac, linux or wirndows, which gives a great advantage.  
Also this time I choose to work with kind because it allows to do a lot of stuff like simulating multiple control plane nodes and multiple workernodes. In my case I did wanted multiple nodes to try things like running postgres clusters and use anti affinity to develop in my laptop some automation around postgres clusters. It is very fast to start a cluster and play around with multiple clusters. Another cool feature is that is easy to start a cluster with multiple masters and the setup of the cluster seems a very "vanilla" k8s cluster which is and advantage to be running things similar to what you would run in production others like k3s or microk8s use a lot of lightweight components that might not actually look like "production clusters", however this is still a very personal opinion and depends on the needs of the developer and all have pros and cons. We will see how it looks like after I actually finish the post and get some conclusions.

# Installation

Installation of kind is pretty straightforward, the requirement is to have docker already installed in your laptop/server/vm and follow the [Official Kind Guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

# Getting a cluster going

We will be creating a cluster in a similar way we created a cluster with other tools [in a past post]({{< relref "multinode-k8s-ignite-k3s.md" >}}) and at the end of the post I will do some basic comparison of what I experienced working with both.  

## Creating a cluster

We will start creating the most basic cluster...
```bash
# Just by issuing this command you get a fresh new cluster
$ kind create cluster

You can now use your cluster with:

# now let's delete the cluster, as easy as that.
$ kind delete cluster
Deleting cluster "kind" ...
```
This a a very basic cluster setup, however I really wanted something more complex to work with. Follow the link if you want to see a full list of what can be tweaked in [kind configurations](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/)  
Let's see an example configuration with 1 control plane (master node) and 2 worker nodes.  
We need to create a config file lets name it `my-cluster.yml` with the following.
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
# One control plane node and two "workers".
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
```
Then run
```bash
# Create the cluster named my-cluster
$ kind create cluster --name my-cluster --config my-cluster.yml

```
With this setup we are running a 3 "nodes" k8s cluster so we are ready to start applying yaml files to deploy some workloads...  
But wait, if you are running on linux you will be able to access the k8s "nodes" with the ip docker assigned to the nodes, but when running in Mac or Windows there are some extra steps to take, as we all know docker desktop in mac or windows still runs inside a linux vm, so we need to take extra steps to get access to the workloads we will be setting up.  
Before proceeding we will have to delete our cluster and 
```bash
$ kind delete clusters my-cluster
Deleted clusters: ["my-cluster"]
```
We will need to setup ingress controller and some port mappings to the workloads we want to run, if we want to access the workloads from the machine. Here are the official docs how to configure an [ingres](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress/) in kind.  

```bash
# To create the cluster again we will take a dirrefent approach.
# we will use a one shot command passing the yaml config from the cli, 
# this saves a step to prevent creating the file.
# we will add the ports we want to access. normally would be 80 
# and 443 but in this case I also added 8080
$ cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --name=my-cluster --config=-

Now we have a ready to go cluster to play around running my workloads...  
In the next setion we will run a hello world app that will help

# Running a workload
We will run the workload the same way as a previous [post]({{< relref "multinode-k8s-ignite-k3s.md" >}}) so we can compare one another.  

```bash
# Run an echoserver to test the installation
$ kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4

# Conclusions

I really enjoyed running kind on my laptop for this test. It's a great tool to run kubernetes clusters very fast in a local laptop, the official documentation is good.  
I like the fact that I could run multiple "nodes" in my cluster also there is some tunning that can be done to suit your needs, it is very easy to spin up clusters with multiple control planes, it is very lightweight as it is running docker containers (if you are running on windows or Mac, it's still running 1 vm).  
Takes care of all boilerplate configs specially kubectl config, and integrates in a seemless way with your exisiting kube config adding and removing contexts as you create clusters, this is great because in the past I had trouble with other tools screwing my kube config.  
But the feature I liked the most is speed, everything happens really fast and it is easy to teardown and spin it back up in a matter of minutes without a lot of effort, making it easy to start over when things go wrong.  
What I din't like, is that there are some limitations because of the fact that it's running in docker, specially if you are working with ingresses configurations or load balancers some special configurations or hacks need to be put in place to make them work which makes harder to reproduce staging or production environments when trying to automate deployments. It is limited in the networking side when tryning some CNI plugins like multus where you might need to have "nodes" with special configurations in order to get multiple networks working.  
However, it is still a great tool to develop and work with and still have a good environment to develop in a local environment. It is still considered alpha stage and it can't be deployed in production environments, it's main purpose is development of applications and kubernetes components.
