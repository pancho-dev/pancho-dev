I have seen in the last couple of years some interesting trends in term of how companies use the public cloud services, how companies migrate to the cloud. My background comes from the networking and the traditional sysadmin world where companies would have their own networks, servers and datacenter. That has changed dramatically in the last 15 years with the appearance of public clouds like AWS, GCP and Azure. A lot of companies migrated completely the IT services to the clouds, it allowed them to grow and design applications for scale in a quick fashion.  
All the incredible growth in the IT industry for last 15 years was lead by quick development and quick scaling, lower time to market and lower initial infrastructure cost for IT startups. Also the explosion of mobile users and mobile apps required a big amount of IT services like compute storage which was unprecedented. Public clouds allowed to cover or the IT needs and scalability form small to big companies.


## The cloud

What we refer to the cloud it means public clouds, where anyone can sign up and get IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). There are numerous providers and they allow any company to quickly provision infrastructure, like virtual machines, storage, databases, serverless functions and probably hundreds of different ready to go IT services.  
The allow companies to focus on their product instead of building complex and expensive infrastructure, it allows products to grow and removed the burden for maintaining infrastructure.  
One of the key factors to using the cloud is the initial cost of ownership and the easy way to manage the infrastructure.
